# survey
Following from some thoughts [here](https://github.com/codebuddies/v3/issues/8), let's create an (automated) survey of codebuddies.

Conducting surveys can be a great way to identitify technology trends and get a pulse of the community. We could use one of many existing survey-as-a-service product offerings, but it would be much more fun to build one from scratch.

There have been [two](https://medium.com/codebuddies/codebuddies-community-survey-results-really-insightful-commentary-from-yall-8dcb36965d71) codebuddies [surveys](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zwVYxbahwYSMrX5QhJ3akhYcYAdYmzAFfidHxmCGlSk/edit#gid=712701383) in the past. These are probably the best place to start, and we may be able to re-use a lot of what's there, but there is currently no ability to analyze trends and impact over time.

Some key principles:
- CodeBuddies has the potential to be around for a long time. Make design and technology decisions with long term durability and data analysis in mind.
- Use web standards and technologies that make the site [accessible](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility) to people with disabilities. 
- Don't store response data that could be tied to a particular individual at any time. Try to prevent duplicate responses, but don't sacrifice privacy or security.
- Ask questions of the community that either help CodeBuddies itself improve, or would give its members insight into technology trends that may be beneficial to their goals.
